# Coding
<h2> Reorganization </h2>
<p> After this I will be reorganizing how I write code. <br/>
    No more sloppiness, no more mass committing it into one file.
  <br/>Been watching too much GeoHot, have to change many of the things <br/>
  I do to attempt to emulate his behavior. </p>
<h2> Usage </h2>
<p> This is used for storing the basic files that I need when opening/running<br/>
    a new instance of Unix or Linux on another computer. It has the bash_profile, <br/>
    the bashrc and the vimrc that I need because I'm a noob. </p>
